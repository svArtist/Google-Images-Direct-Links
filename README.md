# Google Images Direct Links
**Adds direct links to pictures and source pages to Google image search results.**

The other day I noticed that Google Images had changed for me.
Clicking on a picture no longer opens the result page, but slides an (albeit neat looking) panel open, providing me with the links.

I don't want that, so I wrote a userscript that will add a "+" button to every picture. Click that button to go to the image directly, or hold CTRL to open the reference page.

Hope you like it :)
